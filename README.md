# UdemyApp
This project was generated with .Net7-API

# Getting Started

This project is a multilayered Web API application developed on Multitier architecture and best practices.

# Code scaffolding

As generic, we first created our core, repository and service layers.After that, we downloaded the libraries required for our project and we created our controller classes and the multilayered architecture, respectively.

# Build
The final version of the project works both on the API side and on the web side. In both applications, it allows us to perform get, update, remove operations on our server.
